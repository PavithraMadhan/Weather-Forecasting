Towards Accelerating & Interpretable Weather Forecasting using Deep Network Learning

The Novelty idea lies on development of a hybrid forecasting system that integrates machine learning techniques with physics-based models. This hybrid approach would leverage the strengths of both methodologies to improve the accuracy and reliability of precipitation forecasts. By combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the physical understanding of atmospheric processes, the hybrid model could capture complex interactions and nonlinear relationships that are challenging for traditional models to represent accurately. 
Additionally, the incorporation of machine learning could enable the model to learn from historical data and adapt to changing weather patterns in real-time, enhancing its predictive capabilities.
